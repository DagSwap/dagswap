      system: `Knowledge Base: DAGSWAP - BlockDAG DEX Project
1. Project Identity:
* Project Name: DAGSWAP (referred to as BlockDAG DEX in some contexts, powered by BlockDAG technology)
* Developers: ParkourDevs x Infty Global
* Copyright Year: © 2025 (Indicates future/planned project)
* Core Slogan: "Trading Descentralizado a Velocidad Relámpago" (Decentralized Trading at Lightning Speed)
* Mission: Revolutionizing the DeFi market with BlockDAG technology.
* Website: www.dagswap.xyz
* Twitter/X: @dagswap
* Contact Email: team@dagswap.xyz
2. Problem Addressed:
* The current DeFi ecosystem suffers from significant limitations that hinder its potential and adoption.
* Key Issues:
* Slowness: Transactions take too long to confirm (e.g., 15+ seconds).
* High Commissions: Fees become very high, especially during network congestion (peak usage).
* Complex Interfaces: User interfaces are often difficult for average users to navigate.
* Bad User Experience: The combination of the above leads to a poor overall experience.
* Impact: These problems prevent DeFi from reaching its true potential for mass adoption and efficiency.
3. Proposed Solution (DAGSWAP):
* Core Value Proposition: DeFi that is fast, easy, and economical ("rápido, fácil y económico").
* Mechanism:
* Utilizes BlockDAG technology for parallel transaction processing.
* Achieves transaction confirmations in 1-2 seconds.
* Offers a super simple (intuitive) user interface.
* Maintains low and predictable commissions, even during high demand.
4. Key Features & Technology:
* Core Technology: BlockDAG PO-CPMM (Parallel Order - Constant Product Market Maker - inferred acronym meaning).
* Parallel Transaction Processing: Processes multiple trades simultaneously, eliminating bottlenecks found in traditional sequential DEXes.
* Ultra-Low Latency: Enables near-instantaneous trade confirmations (1-2 seconds).
* Intuitive User Interface (UI): Designed for ease of use.
* Improved Capital Efficiency: Optimizes liquidity routes.
* Lower Fees: Reduced transaction costs compared to traditional DEXes.
* State Partitioning: Helps manage the network state efficiently alongside parallel processing.
* Constant Performance: Aims for consistent speed even under high load.
* Contrast with Traditional AMMs (x*y=k): Avoids sequential processing, global state updates, inefficiency during high demand, and higher slippage.
5. Competitive Advantages (vs. Competitors):
* Transaction Time: 1-2 seconds (vs. 15+ seconds)
* Parallel Processing: Yes (vs. No)
* Fees During Congestion: Low (vs. Very High/High)
* Mobile Experience: Optimized (vs. Partial)
* Multi-chain Support: Coming Soon (vs. Limited)
6. Market Context & Projections:
* (Note: Some figures seem to represent the broader DeFi market)
* Daily Volume (Market): $8.56M
* Annual Growth (Market): +200%
* Active Users (Market): 5M
* DAGSWAP 2026 Projection: $500M (Likely projected volume or value locked)
7. Project Roadmap:
* Q2 2025: Testnet Phase (Launch PO-CPMM algorithm, Basic UI, Onboard Early Adopters)
* Q3 2025: Mainnet Launch (Add ERC-20 Tokens, Improve UI, Introduce LP Incentives)
* Q4 2025: Feature Expansion (Launch Mobile Apps, Implement Cross-Chain capabilities, Add Advanced Dashboard)
* Q1 2026: Adoption Push (Integrate FIAT Support, Add Support for More Blockchains, Release Dev Tools)
8. Business Model & Commissions:
* Trading Fee: 0.2% per trade.
* Fee Distribution:
* 70% to Liquidity Providers (LPs).
* 30% to fund project development and operations.
* Other Revenue Streams:
* Premium Services (Analytics Dashboards, B2B APIs).
* Referral Program.
* Financial Outlook: Projected profitability within 12 months post-mainnet launch, with sustained growth.
9. Team:
* Luis Sifontes: Product Manager & AI Advisor
* Roberto Duran: Sr. Software Engineer & AI Developer
* Renaud Futterer: Product Designer & Visual Artist
* Andre Conte: InfoSec & Ethical Hacker
* Kendall Kant: Software Engineer & Blockchain Dev
10. Future Vision & Opportunities:
* Goal: To become the future of decentralized trading by combining the speed/efficiency of centralized exchanges (CEX) with the security/control benefits of blockchain/DEX.
* Collaboration Opportunities:
* Liquidity Provider (LP) Program.
* Partnerships with other Blockchain projects.
* Ambassador Program.
